    <h1>Important Milestones in Tech History</h1>

  <div class="milestone-1">

      <h2>Apple Macintosh</h2>
    </header>
    <p> <strong> One of the most impactful days in the history of technology was when Steve Jobs launched the first Macintosh in January 1984. With Vangelis’ “Chariots of Fire” playing in the background, the Apple co-founder showcased a number of the
        Macintosh’s capabilities, from its ability to “talk” to a drawing application that was able to produce sophisticated images. Steve Jobs had grand ambitions for the product. “Macintosh is targeted at two primary markets. The first is the 25
        million ‘knowledge workers’ who sit behind desks, and particularly those in medium and small-sized businesses. And the second market is the college worker, we think that’s the knowledge worker of tomorrow and there are over 11 million college
        students in America alone.” The Apple Macintosh led to major growth for the company as a whole and began a new era in technology. This era of Apple’s domination in technology is still extremely prevalent in today’s culture if not even more
        dominating than before.</p>

      <h2>The Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Launched within weeks of each other in 1994, the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation consoles blazed a trail in the video gaming industry. While the PlayStation has outlasted the Saturn through multiple iterations, including today’s PlayStation
      4, both consoles had a significant impact and influence on home entertainment. Unlike the Super Nintendo, Sega Mega Drive and other similar consoles, games for the Saturn and PlayStation came on CDs rather than cartridges. The consoles had
      enough power inside to showcase games including the visually stunning “Nights into Dreams” on the Saturn and “Final Fantasy VII,” an in-depth role-playing game on the PlayStation. These two consoles helped push gaming into becoming what it is
      today. Today gaming has turned into some people’s lifestyles. There is now competitive gaming and there is a ton of money in the gaming business as a whole. Gaming is one of the most important innovations in the history of technology. </p>

      <h2>Connected Living</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Connected living is a much more recent milestone in technology but in the few years connected living has existed it has come a very long way. Connected living can be used with anything from smartphones and smart TVs to virtual assistants, such
      as amazon echo or google home, and tablets. With one tap of your screen on your phone or a voice command to a virtual assistant to turn your lights on or even change the color of your lights. With the click of a button, a song being played on a
      computer in someone’s bedroom can be beamed to and displayed on a 72-inch TV in their living room via a high speed, wireless connection. This merging of physical and virtual worlds is known as the internet of things. Connected living is now in
      many people lives and is extremely convenient. Connected living is a pretty cool thing and makes life a little easier. </p>

      <h2>Apple CarPlay and Android Auto</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Though they are loath to admit it, many manufacturer infotainment systems — the do-it-all screens that control stereo, navigation, and climate control — aren't very user-friendly. That's why we like Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto.
      Plug in your smartphone and it takes over that big screen, replacing it with something that looks a lot more familiar and easy to use. You'll get a simplified control scheme to access your music, maps, and your phone's built-in voice-control
      features while avoiding the unnecessarily complicated system that comes with the car. Basically every manufacturer has promised support for at least one or both Apple and Google's systems, but not all trim levels will support them. Make sure to
      verify your car has the right options, and that it matches your mobile devices. Almost everyone listens to music in their car and things like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto make it much easier on people who use their products. </p>

      <h2>Social Media </h2>
    </header>
    <p>The current milestone affecting society today is social media. From Twitter to Facebook, these socializing entities are more powerful than traditional war or wind power. People talk, comment, question and even advertise through social media
      outlets. They are important for both personal and business use, fusing the two realms that used to be entirely separate. With the ease of apps on a smartphone or tablet, social media travels with you at all times. Society’s milestones vary from
      simple inventions to life-altering technology. Social media, even though it hasn’t been here for long, has come an extremely long way since it was created. It changes so much down to every day, every day new updates come out to help improve the
      apps. Social media has drastically evolved in its young life and evolution will continue to improve in the coming years. Social media doesn’t look like it’s going anywhere for a long time. </p>
